Python Quiz Game
Here I have built an interactive python quiz program. 
The game is pretty simple to play.
Firstly, the user will be asked to create an account to play the game.
Secondly, they will be given choice to select which quiz they want to play (C, Python, Java)
Each quiz consists of 3 rounds. The user needs to get at least a few answers correct in order to move towards the next stage.
For every correct answer, user will earn 1 point.

There is an admin panel too, where he/she can add or remove quiz questions accordingly.

This is how the UI looks like
